						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>I was in a chat and one day and the topic of MBTI types came up. Soon enough everyone in the room was taking a online test to determine their type. As the results came in it became clear that many in the room had types that were rare in the general population. I independently began collecting the data. Wanting to learn more about databases, I built a small MySQL database to house the data. Wanting to learn more about web development, I built this small site in PHP to display the results.</p>
