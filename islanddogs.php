            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Island Dogs is the first app that I was assigned to as project manager. This app was made for Mary Lee Arts and was built over the course of a year. It was released into the iPad App Store December of 2012. Island Dogs was built by a team of 10 part-timers. Mary Lee set the vision and created the overall concept and, working with her, I turned the ideas into an app. I managed all aspects of the app development including programming, audio production, and graphics production.</p>
