	      <h2>My first experience with team management...</h2>
	      <p>was in 2011.
	        I was house manager for my college fraternity. It was 16 men in one house. With many different fraternity events happening in the house, I was often corralling housemates to attend, to show up on time and to come prepared. We also had associates (what another fraternity might call pledges...minus all the nasty hazing). Associates were invited to some events but not all. There were also associate only events.
	      </p>

	      <h2>I like Refactoring Legacy Code.</h2>
				<p>
					In my personal project, PILLARS, I originally wrote interactions using jQuery. I wrote functional but less-than-optimized code. In the months and weeks after I started the project I reviewed the code written as far back as Day One and refactored the <i>particularly</i> less-than-optimized functions.

					My experience with using the Internet, professional relationships, and personal relationships as resources to call upon when I get stuck on a coding puzzle should be of great value to your incredible team.

				I imagine that your incredible platform would have been very useful in my fraternity years. I might have been able to add events to the schedule, notify members, invite different subgroups, and more.

				I am available for immediate contact and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help
your company meet its goals.
